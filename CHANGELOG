	- In data blocks, a value that is known to be a relocated address where
	  the address the value is located in had that value relocated, now gets
	  displayed as a symbol.
	- Search for text is now implemented.  It basically does a case-insensitive
	  search for that text in either the label, instruction or operand text.
	  The prolonged action system is used to prevent locking up the UI, and to
	  both show progress and to allow the user to cancel.
	- Symbols on a line within a data block can now be followed.
